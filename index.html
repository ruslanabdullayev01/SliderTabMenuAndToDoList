                        The BMW M5 is a high performance variant of the BMW 5
                        Series marketed under the BMW M sub-brand. It is
                        considered an iconic vehicle in the sports sedan
                        category. The majority of M5s have been produced in the
                        sedan (saloon) body style, but in some countries the M5
                        was also available as a wagon (estate) from 1992 to 1995
                        and from 2006 to 2010. The first M5 model was hand-built
                        in 1985 on the E28 535i chassis with a modified engine
                        from the M1 that made it the fastest production sedan at
                        the time. M5 models have been produced for every
                        generation of the 5 Series since 1985.

                        Series, developed by BMW's in-house motorsport division,
                        BMW M GmbH. M3 models have been produced for every
                        generation of 3 Series since the E30 M3 was introduced
                        in 1986. The initial model was available in a coupé body
                        style, with a convertible body style made available soon
                        after. M3 saloons were offered initially during the E36
                        (1994–1999) and E90 (2008–2012) generations. Since 2014,
                        the coupé and convertible models have been rebranded as
                        the 4 Series range, making the high-performance variant
                        the M4, so that generation of 3 Series saw the M3
                        produced only as a saloon. In 2020, the M3 was produced
                        as an estate (Touring) for the first time, alongside the
                        saloon.

                        Series automobile developed by BMW's motorsport
                        division, BMW M GmbH. As the 2 Series replaced the 1
                        Series coupé and convertible models, the
                        first-generation M2 was marketed as the most basic M Car
                        in the range. The first-generation M2 used the F8x
                        chassis from the M3/M4, code name F87 and featured a
                        more powerful and responsive, turbocharged and slightly
                        modified BMW N55 series engine, while its successors,
                        the M2 Competition and M2 CS, featured a
                        high-performance twin-turbocharged engine developed by
                        BMW M GmbH (S55 engine); improved handling, suspension,
                        and braking systems; aerodynamic body enhancements;
                        interior/exterior accents with the tri-colour "M"
                        (Motorsport) badging and increased weight. The M2 is
                        unofficially considered as an indirect successor to the
                        BMW 1 Series M Coupé.
